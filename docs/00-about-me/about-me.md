Hi, I'm **Thanh VO**. I've been working as a Consultant at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) since late 2024. 

With over 7 years of experience, I’ve had the opportunity to work across diverse industries, including banking, insurance, software development, and consulting.

I’m passionate about sharing my knowledge and solving challenges, which is one of the main reasons I created this [website](https://ht-vo.github.io).
